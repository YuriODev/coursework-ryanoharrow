### Benefits of This Structure


**Modularity:** By breaking down the code into smaller, focused modules, each part of the game (like different chess pieces) can be developed, tested, and debugged independently.


**Extensibility:** Adding new features or pieces becomes easier. For example, if you wanted to add a new piece to the game, you could simply add another module in the pieces directory.


**Maintainability:** With a clear separation of concerns, understanding, updating, and maintaining the codebase becomes more straightforward.


**Reusability:** Common functionality, like movement patterns shared by multiple pieces, can be implemented in the base Piece class or utility functions, reducing code duplication.
